 * @file IRLine.h
 * @brief Interface for reading and processing a line of IR sensors used by the
 * micro-rato robot for line following and node detection.
 *
 * This header declares the IRLine_t class which stores the raw sensor values
 * and provides helpers to read sensors, encode the sensor state, compute line
 * edges, calibrate sensors and detect nodes (crossings). 
 *
 * Usage summary:
 *  - call readIRSensors() periodically to sample the IRSensors into
 *    `IR_values`;
 *  - use calcIRLineEdgeLeft()/calcIRLineEdgeRight() to compute a line position
 *    estimate; and
 *  - call detectNode() to check for nodes/crossings on the line.
